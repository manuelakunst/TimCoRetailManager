Application Ideas:
* Actually interact with the inventory
* Move the API to Azure
  (SQL in Azure would cost 5$/month, so Manu will not do this, but whatch of course)
* CI/CD process
  (look for Tims course "application ligecycle design")
* Deploy the Desktop App to the Blob Storage for download
* Introduce a web based inventory control system (Blazor?)
* Web based reporting
* A Xamarin Forms app for a mobile register


Phase 2 Roadmap
1. Take advantage of .NET Core
2. Setup a simple task board in Azure DevOps
3. CI/CD with Azure DevOps (move source code to Azure DevOps?)
4. Move the API to Azure
5. Move the data base to Azure SQL
6. Deploy the desktop app to the Azure Blob Storage 
7. Web-based inventory control system
